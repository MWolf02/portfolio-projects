In this project, i follow along a youtube tutorial, building a fully responsive UI/UX website called "brainwave".  It's inspired by the teachings of the "Javascript Mastery" YouTube channel, but I also added some personal touches and functionality.  With its sleek design and good marketing, it is aiming a getting the customer to buy a digital service, that is using the newest of AI capabilites and functionality.

The website is purely made for practice purposes, to gain more hands-on practice with tailwindcss and sharpen my React skills. This project will be displayed in my portfolio.
